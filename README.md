# Playwright Automation Project

**Last Updated:** June 3rd, 2024  
**Includes Coding Interview Exercises**

Welcome to my repository for the Playwright Automation course! This project is a culmination of everything I learned, from the basics of Playwright to advanced frameworks, all while building practical skills in test automation.

## Course Overview

This comprehensive Playwright course taught me how to automate testing for a fully functional e-commerce application. I learned to handle various scenarios, including dynamic components often found in modern React and Angular applications, without needing any prior JavaScript experience.

Throughout the course, I explored both UI and API testing, understanding how to perform end-to-end functional testing in a single script that creates, tests, and deletes data.

### Key Features

- **End-to-End Testing**: I implemented a single script to automate both UI and API testing, creating a seamless testing experience.
- **Advanced Techniques**: I learned to grab session cookies via APIs, allowing me to bypass UI login screens for faster and more reliable test execution.
- **Frameworks**: The project includes two powerful frameworks for designing test cases:
  - **Playwright Cucumber BDD Framework**
  - **Playwright with Mocha**
- **CI/CD Integration**: I integrated the complete framework with Jenkins and Docker containers for efficient test execution.
- **Robust Logging**: Utilizing Playwright's logging capabilities, I incorporated screenshots, videos, and tools like Playwright Inspector and Traces to provide detailed insights after test execution.

## Project Structure

- **Web/UI Automation**: I mastered core Playwright concepts for comprehensive UI automation.
- **Mixed Web & API Testing**: I combined UI and API testing, using network mocking to enhance my automation capabilities.
- **Advanced Framework Features**: I delved deep into advanced Playwright frameworks for optimal test design.
